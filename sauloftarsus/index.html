            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
               Saul of Tarsus uses elements of classic turn based RPGs to simulate theological debates between the player and other characters in the game. The game begins on the road to Damascus just before Saul's encounter with Jesus. It follows Saul into the city where he meets Ananius and begins his new life as a Christian. As Saul continues his journey interacting with the people of Damascus he learns various new ministry techniques, each with unique effects based real life evangelistic approaches. 
            </p>
            <p>
               One technique that he learns early on after becoming a believer is a move called Testimony. This move is effective against all adversaries and only becomes more powerful as he progresses in his ministry. Another move learned early on is Vulnerability, which trades self-image for an increase in Faith and Resolve. Humble Disposition is a status move that triples the player's Defense for 5 turns. These and various other techniques can be learned throughout the game as Saul continues to grow in his newfound Faith.
