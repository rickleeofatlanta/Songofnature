											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>

									<h2>Gameplay</h2>
									<p>
										Saul of Tarsus uses elements of classic turn based RPGs to simulate theological debates between the player and other characters in the game. The game begins on the road to Damascus just before Saul&#39;s encounter with Jesus. It follows Saul into the city where he meets Ananius and begins his new life as a Christian. As Saul continues his journey interacting with the people of Damascus he learns various new ministry techniques, each with unique effects based real life evangelistic approaches.

									</p>

										<p>
											One technique that he learns early on after becoming a believer is a move called Testimony. This move is effective against all adversaries and only becomes more powerful as he progresses in his ministry. Another move learned early on is Vulnerability, which trades self-image for an increase in Faith and Resolve. Humble Disposition is a status move that triples the player&#39;s Defense for 5 turns. These and various other techniques can be learned throughout the game as Saul continues to grow in his newfound Faith.

											He gave his life to Christ in spring of 2013, shortly after
											being accepted into the University of Central FLorida. He studied

										<p> Rick began working on Saul of Tarsus in Winter of 2021
											as a small hobby that quickly grew into a passionate expression
											of his faith as an artist. He continued working on the game for 
											over Three years while working full time and finishing Seminary.
											He hoped that when finished, his game could help to inspire young people
											to become excited about minisry, and encourage them to be unafraid to defend 
											their in an increasingly secular world.
