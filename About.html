          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">About Song of Nature</h2>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            Song of Nature is an independent Christian creative studio founded in 2013, dedicated to producing story-rich, faith-centered content across film, games, and digital media. The studio was established with a focus on thoughtful storytelling, artistic quality, and meaningful engagement, aiming to communicate Christian themes in ways that are accessible, imaginative, and sincere.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            The studio’s early work centered on short-form filmmaking, releasing several allegorical short films including <em>Escape from Aqua Place</em> (2015), <em>Ape and Turtle and the Fire Monster</em> (2016), and <em>The Snowy Owl</em> (2017), which explored themes such as faith, temptation, and redemption, and helped define the studio’s narrative-driven approach.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            In later years, Song of Nature expanded into interactive media. The studio released <em>Saul of Tarsus</em> (2025), a Bible-based role-playing game focused on the early ministry of the Apostle Paul. Developed over more than three years, the game blends classic RPG mechanics with theological dialogue and moral decision-making. Since its release on Steam, Google Play, and iOS, <em>Saul of Tarsus</em> has reached players in over 100 countries, with strong engagement from both Christian and non-Christian audiences.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            With a growing international reach, Song of Nature continues to pursue projects that combine craftsmanship, storytelling, and faith, with the long-term goal of creating content that encourages reflection, curiosity, and meaningful engagement with the Christian worldview.
          </p>

          <!-- About the Founder -->
          <h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1em;">About the Founder</h2>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            Rick Lee is a Christian creative, filmmaker, and solo indie game developer, and the founder of Song of Nature. He began the studio while studying film at the University of Central Florida, where he developed a strong interest in visual storytelling, production design, and narrative-driven media.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            Alongside his creative work, Rick pursued theological education, earning a Master of Divinity and spending several years studying Christian theology, apologetics, and biblical studies. This combination of formal theological training and artistic background has shaped his approach to storytelling, particularly his interest in communicating faith through narrative rather than didactic instruction.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            Rick is best known for creating <em>Saul of Tarsus</em>, a faith-based RPG that introduces theological concepts through interactive dialogue and gameplay. The project was developed independently over several years and has reached tens of thousands of players worldwide. His earlier work includes award-winning short films, including recognition at the Bruhaha Film & Video Showcase in Orlando.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            Through Song of Nature, Rick continues to explore new ways of blending faith, art, and interactive storytelling, with future projects spanning both video games and narrative-driven video content.
