      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">About Song of Nature</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">I started Song of Nature in 2013 as a freshman in Film School. As a new believer and a lifelong artist, I wanted to create a production studio focused on story-rich, high-quality Christian content.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">The first titles I released under the label were three allegorical short films: <em>Escape from Aqua Place</em> (2015), which explored faith; <em>Ape and Turtle and the Fire Monster</em> (2016), which dealt with temptation; and <em>The Snowy Owl</em> (2017), which focused on redemption.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">After film school, I continued writing stories in my spare time, producing several early drafts that are still in development. A few of these include <em>A Song of Crows</em>, <em>Shadow of Aracnia</em>, and <em>Squirrel and Mole: Beneath Water's Deep</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">During this time, I began Seminary, earning a Master of Divinity while studying theology for six years. About halfway through, I started working on <em>Saul of Tarsus</em>, a Bible-based video game about the early ministry of the Apostle Paul. I spent the next three and a half years completing and refining the project.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">On March 5th, 2025, Song of Nature Media released <em>Saul of Tarsus</em> on Steam, Google Play, and iOS. Since its release, <em>Saul of Tarsus</em> has reached players in over 100 countries, with the largest audiences in Brazil, the Philippines, Argentina, Indonesia, South Africa, India, and the United States, transitioning Song of Nature from an umbrella of personal projects to a budding global ministry.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; text-align: left;">With this growing interest, the studio looks to the future with optimism, planning to create more faith-based content to continue its mission of reaching people everywhere with the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.</p>
